The reviewed GitLab/source-fidelity and structured-rate documentation is live from exact Connectors main `0c69450921ab1794c81dadec915b717a61bf0983`. The Website retained maintenance source at `5430e47165c44d7f995688a79ac2badc7a6c0a3c` passes its complete gate and Atlas retained-artifact verification. This report records implementation and delivery evidence; publication of the Website maintenance branch proceeds separately through its normal PR. No release, tag, runtime pin or external consumer adoption is claimed.

Connectors PR18 merged through the normal Atlas bot wrapper at 14:30:35 UTC after CI34037821332 passed all twelve workspace gates, checks and four native platform builds/smoke tests. Its tag-only release job was skipped. All nineteen introduced direct commits have the exact bot author and committer; main's tree equals the reviewed `fdad9c0e21a3afb521a0b88fef222211293e5dc2`. Earlier local source verification remains the separate immutable Connectors report with 2,244 passing executions across all required configurations.

Website used Node24.20.0 and the exact committed dependency lock. Ordinary anonymous remote-backed collection visited all twenty-four roster entries. Four generated rows advanced: Connectors, Devcenter, ESS and Workspace; the roster, URLs, manifest paths and manifest hashes stayed unchanged. Workspace's content hash is unchanged. All twenty locked rows outside that set stayed byte-identical. Every locked commit is remotely published and present as a sibling Git object; no primary working files or refs were changed. An explicit second freshness collection passed. The lock SHA256 is `c709781ccaa1190430d2d24760c045c2a9b2d45a0364b4573e962fe62ac16365`.

The lock was checkpointed at `93994ac2ab2f2e6aaeeeb7de15c228620470e61b`. Clean exact Atlas main `b0fb59be02712e221c2a07d3e589120ed0ae3d7a` rendered the four-file retained snapshot. The generated ecosystem was unchanged; changes, release facts and metadata were committed at `5430e47165c44d7f995688a79ac2badc7a6c0a3c`. All snapshot identities and declared file hashes were independently verified. The proper-named reused Atlas binary SHA256 `571ee4fcabc3dc62ab02084f5c7d210a8326f373ba64f8b151f19e6c4438ab74` is from reviewed b4a66b91; its Rust source, manifests/lock, embedded catalog definitions and workflow bytes match current b0. No Atlas compiler or installed-hook mutation was needed.

The complete remote-backed `npm run gate` passed: 99 tests, zero failures; critical dependency audit; six experience definitions and the v4 manifest; typecheck and source/build code-rendering contracts; static build; navigation links across 357 HTML pages; golden search queries; responsive diagram/table/navigation checks; crawl and final provenance verification of 356 routes and 1,328 files. `atlas docs verify-portal --website <managed tree> --artifact <build>` passed separately. Both checks identify retained provenance v1; they are not used as v2 validators.

No local command was interrupted. The prospective 12 GiB reserve and one-build-at-a-time policy were preserved. Persistent complete logs, exact arguments, exits, one-second resource samples and hashes are under `~/.cache/cw6/p`, indexed by `schema3-website-delivery-local-evidence.json`. The exact nonplanning source inventory is `schema3-website-verified-nonplanning-source.json`; later planning-only closure does not claim a new execution of this same build.

Automatic publication followed its bundle/source-set owner. Root dispatched only `{ref:main, inputs:{reconcile:true}}` after the exact new Connectors producer succeeded, with no legacy Website SHA, hold, rollback or runtime-control change. The full independent observation report below is retained byte-for-byte. Root verified all 1,793 hashes in its frozen manifest (`99187be3fd906ebfd65173a9a11fdf88c7f5b6b3dbfe24cad6f3dacc0f70a393`). Its earlier baseline, including `fresh:false` while Connectors advanced, and temporary publication-provenance mismatches remain preserved.

Atlas's prior separately recorded complete workspace fence still has three unrelated primary-checkout failures: AgentIDE's unsupported v4 collector path, the primary Website's wrong Docs System pin, and Widgets' missing Serves declaration. They were neither edited nor counted as green. The exact managed Website retained gate, automatic artifact verification and current full live Atlas delivery check are green. No assertion is made that every organization fence or external consumer migration is complete.

## Complete independent automatic publication report

Automatic publication of the merged Connectors source is validated. Frozen 2026-09-06T14:46:17.133934+00:00. This is read-only delivery evidence, not an adversary pass or architecture approval.

Atlas reconciliation run `34039715421/1` completed successfully at 14:42:30 UTC. The complete v2 artifact selects Connectors `0c69450921ab1794c81dadec915b717a61bf0983`; live root provenance matches its bytes, the durable mirror matches every artifact path and blob, and final source-set freshness is `{"fresh":true,"advancedSources":[]}`.

All deciding commands exited zero; exact argv, cwd, times and complete outputs are in `commands.json` and each named command's `.command.json`, `.stdout`, `.stderr` files:

- `verify-v2`: Node24 runs exact Website `scripts/verify-build.mjs --publication .../publication --website-data .../wt-5b72ec73c229 --website-sha fc4571534765c098ed861bc326da4d3da0d1df63`; 356 routes and 1,328 files pass layout v2 and deployment agreement.
- `live-pages`: verified Atlas binary runs `--store .../catalog/store docs verify-pages --gh-program gh --curl-program curl`; 37 repository states, 26 Pages repositories, 52 delivery routes and one Website commit pass after publication completed.
- `freshness` and `freshness-final`: `docs check-source-set-freshness --source-set .../publication/inputs/source-set.json --gh-program gh`; both JSON results explicitly report `fresh:true` with no advanced sources.
- `complete-identity-proof`: all 1709 complete artifact files match the nontruncated durable Git tree. Both post-publication live fetches are byte-identical to `publication/site/PROVENANCE.json`. Complete source identities and file hashes are retained.
- `website-runtime-proof`: verifier scripts, workflows, package manifest/lock, roster, legacy routes and experience inputs remain byte-identical to pinned fc457 even though root advanced the retained-lock checkout to `5430e47165c44d7f995688a79ac2badc7a6c0a3c`. This v2 check reads artifact bootstrap/source-set inputs and synthesizes its source lock from the 24 bundles. The reused Atlas binary and embedded-input equality proof remain in the frozen baseline; Node is `~/.nvm/versions/node/v24.20.0/bin/node`.
- `baseline-preservation`: every file covered by the already frozen baseline evidence manifest still matches.

Only the Connectors bundle identity changed from the verified baseline. Its changed content paths are `docs/architecture/interfaces.md`, `docs/design/01-domain-model.md` and `docs/guides/connect-gitlab.md`; bundle and collection metadata also changed. The other 23 selected bundle identities remain exact. This is the manifest-selected documentation delivery, not a claim that every repository file is published or that consumers adopted the new protocol.

Preserved convergence observations: the initial live read at 14:41:28 UTC still selected baseline `4b32397d` while this publication was in progress. The publication job log retains six temporary provenance mismatches through 14:41:56 before convergence. Post-publication reads select the new source and match byte-for-byte. The earlier baseline's `fresh:false` result is retained unchanged in its separate frozen report.

Evidence: `~/.cache/cw6/p/schema3-docs-delivery-preparation/current-publication/new-publication-34039715421`. Original ZIP `download-publication.stdout`; extracted full artifact `publication/`; all 24 selected identities `complete-identity-proof.json`; every file hash `publication-file-inventory.json`; exact API run/job/artifact/mirror responses and publication log retained. Baseline report is the parent directory's `report.md`, SHA256 `780ba828f38228343f2b35c33d70745c7c8cbe5d290fe40e41d0df6eb2c594ed`.

No builds, installs, source/AEP/Git/operator edits or remote writes were performed by this lane. Root issued the normal automatic reconciliation. GitHub reads used the already authorized Atlas App fallback. Public derivative changes only the absolute local home-directory prefix to `~`; paths are plain code references.
